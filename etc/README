Description (ref https://ow.feide.no/sip:sipp).

Sipp is a tool for systematic generation of SIP-calls, and is used to generate automated calls to each of the pilot echo-points to measure availability, call setup time and audio streaming quality. 

We have developed a test scenario for Sipp (sipp-client-media.xml) that sets up a call to an echo service. It transmits a prerecorded sound clip and captures the returning RTP traffic with tcpdump. 

Qstream analyzes RTP streams to measure the quality, like lost packets, resequencing and jitter. 

Tests are being run a configurable number of  successive calls each about 8 seconds every 10 minutes. The results are put into Stager for aggregation and reports (Or on the top Stager page - in the header select report setup = qstream, then for report type select SIP, then create report). 

We have patched Sipp to support systematic repeated calls (auto_media_port) and storing the logs(-trace_dir). 

Minor scripts developed are 
sipp-test(shell script) to run the tests.
sipp-print(perl) - to print sipp .csv -files nicely
getData.php - to take qstream reports to Stager(stager/bin/)

More information is found in /local/net-status/sipp/etc/README A list of echo services is in sipp/etc/poll.cf and data in sipp/data.

Files :

sipp-print   - pretty print  from .csv reports
sipp-test    - shell to start tests based on poll.cf
qstream-sipp - shell to report results from tests - input to stager

/usr/local/bin/tcpdump-vent  - script for running tcpdump to catch rtp-streams(setuid root)
/usr/local/bin/sipp - the sipp program - probably need setuid root
